# Video Summarization Project

## Project Description
This project is a Python-based tool for summarizing video content. It takes a video URL as input, downloads the audio, transcribes it using OpenAI's Whisper model, and then generates a concise summary using a pre-trained language model. The project is particularly useful for quickly understanding the content of long videos without watching them in full.

  Ensure FFmpeg is installed on your system. You can download it from FFmpeg's official website and add it to your system's PATH.

## Usage
  1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash

    jupyter notebook
    
  - Open Video_Summarization.ipynb and follow the steps provided in the notebook.
      
  2. Input Video URL:
     - The notebook prompts you to input a YouTube video URL. The audio from this video will be extracted for summarization.
  3. Transcribe and Summarize:
     - The notebook uses OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe the audio and a pre-trained language model to generate a summary of the transcription.
